I'm not saying it was your fault
Although you could have done more
Oh, you're so naïve, yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way
Something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside
I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
She's still out to get me
I may say it was your fault
Because I know you could have done more
Oh, you're so naïve, yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way something so beautiful
Will die every time I look inside
I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
She's still out to get me
Ooh
So how could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, you're so naïve, yet so
It's such an ugly thing
For someone so beautiful
Will die every time you're on his side
I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
She's still out to get me
Just don't let me down
So just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down, oh
Just don't let me down
Hold on to this kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
